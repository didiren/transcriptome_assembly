#Prepare a text file (parameters.txt) with the RNA-seq files names one per each line as well as the paired end files are next to each other. Here is the example attached that you can download and edit based on your projects:

#This parameters.txt file, the RNA-seq-differential_expression.py file as well as the RNA-seq raw reads files should be in the same directory (one folder).


Good luck.
